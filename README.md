# Avadhoot Dutt | Personal Portfolio

This is the source code for my personal portfolio website, which showcases my achievements, projects, and skills. It is designed to be responsive, simple, and professional, allowing users to navigate and learn about my work easily.

## Design Choices

- **Responsive Layout**: The website is built with a responsive design in mind, making it accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Color Scheme**: The color scheme uses shades of green and white, which creates a clean and minimalistic aesthetic.
- **Smooth Navigation**: Navigation links provide easy access to different sections of the page, using smooth scrolling for a seamless user experience.
- **Accessibility**: Images include alt attributes for better accessibility, and the website is structured for ease of use with screen readers.
- **Typography**: The fonts are selected to be clear and professional, offering a modern yet formal look.
- **Custom Styling**: CSS is used for global styles, section-based layouts, and hover effects to enhance user interaction.
